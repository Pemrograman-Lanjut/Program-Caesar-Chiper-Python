## Introduction:
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher method for encryption and decryption. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is ‘shifted’ a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## Features:
- Encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher method.
- Decrypt a message encrypted using the Caesar Cipher method.
- User-friendly: Prompts user for inputs and displays outputs.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x

## Installation:
1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
2. **Navigate to the directory containing the program.**
3. **Run the program using Python 3.**

## Usage
1. **Run the program.**
2. **Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt by entering ‘E’ or ‘D’.**
3. **If you choose to encrypt:**
    - Enter the plaintext message you want to encrypt.
    - Enter the shift key (an integer).
    - The program will display the encrypted message.
4. **If you choose to decrypt:**
    - Enter the encrypted message you want to decrypt.
    - Enter the shift key (an integer).
    - The program will display the decrypted message.
